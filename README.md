# ccProj
ccProj is a minimum C++ MFC. It is a framework for building windows applications without 3rd run-time dll or libraries. The built release file has very small size and can run on windows XP or even windows NT, 98 or 95. I have maintained the project for more than 10 years and built a lot of free software with it.
